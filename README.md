Zerodha Landing Page - Basic HTML & CSS

This repository is an example of using basic inline CSS in HTML to create a simple Zerodha-inspired landing page.

Why This Project?

During a recent interview, I was asked to create a basic box using HTML and CSS. Despite having strong expertise in React and experience building major projects, I couldn’t deliver the task due to interview pressure and the simplicity of the requirement, which unexpectedly flipped me off.

This project represents my effort to revisit the fundamentals and rebuild confidence in even the most basic concepts. While my focus has always been on advanced development, this experience highlighted the importance of mastering every aspect, no matter how small.
